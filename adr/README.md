# Architecture Decision Records

Architecture Decisions (AD) are justified design choices that shape the structures, behavior, and quantities of a
software system. An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) captures a single AD and its rationale. Put it simply, ADR can
help you understand the reasons for a chosen architectural decision, along with its trade-offs and consequences.

In this project, I will use this shorten [Decision record template by Michael Nygard](https://shorturl.at/OeX39) as a
tool to explain all the things I use in this project.
